## Dear all folks,
👋 I am Stephen, maker of RemoveX. I am super excited to launch RemoveX on Github.

### WHAT IS REMOVEX?

For those of you unfamiliar with RemoveX:

🤩 RemoveX is an uninstaller tool for Mac computers.

🔔 RemoveX has a beautifully designed UI using native design for MacOS. Save hours of time and remove your app in seconds. Do not make you think.

⚡ RemoveX comes with multi-functional support. Many functional logic are written by native Swift code supported by Apple, so that you can believe in RemoveX without having any worries about performance. Your Mac is always optimized.

🦄 RemoveX works on both M1/Intel chips.

### WHY REMOVEX?

💻 The reason I made RemoveX is very simple. I am a developer and I love to build software for everyone to use.

👉 I have tried different tools before, of course, like you, but do you really want to spend more money to buy a complex application with a lot of features you rarely use or do not understand why it exists?

👉 Most people mention the amount of time it takes as a barrier to uninstall an application.

✅ For sure, on MacOS, the user can right click on the application and remove it as well, but the user also needs to click on empty trash. With RemoveX, the user just decides to select an application and remove it forever with no extra-actions .

✅ Right now, we have many big products in the uninstalling software field, but I built RemoveX with a simple way to think, simple way to use and really focus on your requirement - uninstall an application as fast as possible.

🎨 Intuitive UX/UI with a high quality standard.

🔑 Active development and lifetime support.

### HOW ABOUT ROADMAP?

🚀 Many features I am developing to integrate into the RemoveX License. I believe you will love it.

🚀 As said above, all of the features will be clear, simple, easy to use and for you, RemoveX does not make you think more.

🚀 Pretty sure, I will improve the UI/UX in a minimalist way in my mind.

### AND, ANYTHING ELSE?

🤑 RemoveX has a free version forever.

😄 Please feel free to ask any questions or give any feedback.

🗣️ Together, we can make a difference. If you can, please help me to share RemoveX with your friends.
